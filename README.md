Sparkall GUI
--
Sparkall has 3 GUIS:
- Source addition: add Source by setting values to a set of prelisted options
- Source mapping: map entities and attributes to Ontology classes and predicates
- Query: use mappings to query the data

Mappings are saved in:  as mappings.ttl
Data source access configurations are saved in: as config
Query is saved in as query.sparkl

You can change these configurations in the application file
